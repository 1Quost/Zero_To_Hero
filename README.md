# Zero\_To\_Hero 🎮

**A JavaFX Quiz App – University Project**

## 📚 Description

**Zero\_To\_Hero** is a dynamic and interactive quiz application developed as part of a university project. The game challenges users with various questions across multiple categories and difficulty levels, combining fun and learning in a sleek JavaFX interface.

## 🎬 How It Works

* The game starts with an **intro video** to set the tone.
* Players are prompted to **enter their name**. If left blank, the default name **"Player"** is used.
* A **Settings** menu allows players to toggle the **background music**.
* Players then select a **quiz category** and one of three **difficulty levels**: Easy, Medium, or Hard.
